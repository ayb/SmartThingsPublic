# H1 Ron's Guide to installing the ZXT-120 device.

You can find a copy of the manual for this device here also in my github repo.  Note: This may not be your device's version so keep that in mind.  I find this version of the manual describes certain things quite well.  For example how to place the device into "Always Listening Mode.  Older versions of the manual that may come with your device have some errors in describing the steps.
